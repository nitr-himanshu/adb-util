## Technical Considerations

### ADB Integration
- Validate ADB installation on application startup
- Handle device disconnections gracefully
- Support both USB and wireless ADB connections
- Implement command timeout handling

### Security
- Validate file paths to prevent directory traversal
- Sanitize ADB commands to prevent injection
- Secure handling of device credentials
- Permission checks for file operations

### Performance
- Use async/await for non-blocking operations
- Implement progress indicators for long-running tasks
- Cache device information to reduce ADB calls
- Virtual scrolling for large datasets

### Cross-Platform Support
- Handle different ADB binary locations
- Platform-specific file path handling
- Native look and feel on each OS

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **ADB Dependency**: Bundle ADB binary or provide clear installation instructions
- **Device Compatibility**: Test with various Android versions and manufacturers
- **Large File Transfers**: Implement chunked transfers with resume capability

### User Experience Risks
- **Complex Interface**: Prioritize intuitive design and user testing
- **Performance Issues**: Profile and optimize critical paths
- **Error Recovery**: Provide clear error messages and recovery options

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Successfully discover and connect to all connected devices
- [ ] File transfer speeds comparable to command-line ADB
- [ ] Real-time logcat streaming without lag
- [ ] Intuitive interface requiring minimal learning curve
- [ ] Stable operation across different Android devices and versions

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- Plugin system for custom commands
- Device comparison features
- Automated testing workflows
- Team collaboration features
- Cloud backup integration
